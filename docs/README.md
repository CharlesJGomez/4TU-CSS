Software
--------

We will use [python](https://www.python.org/) during our workshop. We will depend on the [scipy stack](http://www.scipy.org/), and it is recommended to use the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) especially if you are on Windows.

Some of the other packages we will rely on during the workshop are:
- [Python NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
- [igraph](http://igraph.org/)
- [louvain](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/louvain/)

All can be installed in Anaconda (or using `pip` if you prefer).
