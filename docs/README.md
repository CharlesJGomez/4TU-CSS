4TU Computational Social Science Seminar
=========================================

With increasing amounts of data the social sciences have the opportunity to become more computationally oriented, bringing together elements of machine learning and data science with substantive social theories. We will provide a brief introduction to the core of the computational social science. The main focus in this workshop is on two key elements of this new field: natural language processing (NLP) and social networks. We will take a hands-on approach, with interactive lectures combining theoretical explanations with actual coding. In the group assignments, we will stimulate an integrated approach to both NLP and network analysis.


Preliminary programme
---------------------

| Time  | Topic |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 10:00 - 10:30 | Computational Social Science introduction   |
| 10:30 - 12:30 | Natural Language Processing (NLP) lab  <br> The first part will focus on applying NLP tools. Topics that will <br>be discussed include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, <br>part-of-speech tagging and feature representation.<br> The second part will focus on NLP to analyze and model <br>social dynamics. We will discuss computational approaches <br>to analyze language & social identity (gender, age, location) <br>and language in interaction (e.g., social relationships,<br> dynamics in online communities). |
| 12:30 - 13:30 | Lunch  |                                   
| 13:30 - 15:30 | Network lab </br> We will start with an overview of traditional network analysis, </br>  covering theories of structural holes and weak ties, and relating </br> them to graph theoretical notions of centrality and paths. We </br> proceed with some more recent developments, covering diffusion </br> and community structure. Finally, we discuss social balance </br> theory, which relates to signed networks, making a connection </br> to NLP.   |                               
| 15:30 - 17:00 | Group assignment |                          
| 17:00 - 17:30 | Wrap up & drinks  |                        

[Optionally: dinner]

Software
--------

We will use [python](https://www.python.org/) during our workshop. We will depend on the [scipy stack](http://www.scipy.org/), and it is recommended to use the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) especially if you are on Windows.

Some of the other packages we will rely on during the workshop are:

- [Python NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
- [igraph](http://igraph.org/)
- [louvain](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/louvain/)

All can be installed in Anaconda (or using `pip` if you prefer).


Location
--------
The seminar will be held at the INFORM space in the [Designlab](https://www.utwente.nl/en/designlab/) of the University of Twente.
