4TU Computational Social Science Seminar 
=========================================
#### 7 April 2017 @ University of Twente


With increasing amounts of data the social sciences have the opportunity to become more computationally oriented, bringing together elements of machine learning and data science with substantive social theories. We will provide a brief introduction to the core of the computational social science. The main focus in this workshop is on two key elements of this new field: natural language processing (NLP) and social networks. We will take a hands-on approach, with interactive lectures combining theoretical explanations with actual coding. In the group assignments, we will stimulate an integrated approach to both NLP and network analysis.


Preliminary programme
---------------------

| Time  | Topic |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 10:00 - 10:30 | Computational Social Science introduction   |
| 10:30 - 12:30 | Natural Language Processing (NLP) lab  <br> The first part will focus on applying NLP tools. Topics that will <br>be discussed include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, <br>part-of-speech tagging and feature representation.<br> The second part will focus on NLP to analyze and model <br>social dynamics. We will discuss computational approaches <br>to analyze language & social identity (gender, age, location) <br>and language in interaction (e.g., social relationships,<br> dynamics in online communities). |
| 12:30 - 13:30 | Lunch  |                                   
| 13:30 - 15:30 | Network lab <br> We will start with an overview of traditional network analysis, <br>  covering theories of structural holes and weak ties, and relating <br> them to graph theoretical notions of centrality and paths. We <br> proceed with some more recent developments, covering diffusion <br> and community structure. Finally, we discuss social balance <br> theory, which relates to signed networks, making a connection <br> to NLP.   |                               
| 15:30 - 17:00 | Group assignment |                          
| 17:00 - 17:30 | Wrap up & drinks  |                        

[Optionally: dinner]

Prerequisite knowledge
----------------------

We intend the workhop to be suitable for graduate students from all disciplines. Because of this, we will not assume any particular skillset. Nonetheless, there will be some coding in [python](https://www.python.org/), because we aim to make the workshop practically relevant. It is therefore advisable to acquaint yourself with python if you have no experience yet. See also below for what software to install prior to the workshop.

Software
--------

The workshop will be interactive, and we plan to switch between theoretical explanations and practical coding during class. Please bring your own laptop, with all prerequisite software installed. If you encounter any issue installing any software, please do not hesitate to contact one of the instructors.

We will use [python](https://www.python.org/) during our workshop. We will depend on the [scipy stack](http://www.scipy.org/), and it is recommended to use the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution especially if you are on Windows.

Some of the other packages we will rely on during the workshop are:

- [Python NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
- [igraph](http://igraph.org/)
- [louvain](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/louvain/)

All can be installed in Anaconda (or using `pip` if you prefer).

It is practical to use python in for example [ipython](http://ipython.org/) or [spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder), both are included in the Anaconda distribution.

Location
--------
The seminar will be held at the INFORM space in the [Designlab](https://www.utwente.nl/en/designlab/) of the University of Twente.
