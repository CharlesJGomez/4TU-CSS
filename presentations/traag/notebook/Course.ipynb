The interesting thing of eigenvector centrality is that it is similar to the proportion of time spent in a node if a *random walker* would traverse the network, choosing links to follow at random. In directed graphs there may be so-called *sinks*: nodes with no outgoing edges. If you think of a random walker, you can imagine the problem: (s)he gets stuck in a sink. The opposite of *sinks* are called *sources*: nodes with no incoming edge. A random walker would then never arrive in a source.\n",

This was introduced by the founders of Google to model a *random surfer*, jumping from webpage to webpage and every now and then starting anew.
